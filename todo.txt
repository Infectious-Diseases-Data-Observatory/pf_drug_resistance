TODO
- simplified and non-simplified versions of ind_shp 
  - leaflet needs full detail polys but static plots fine with simplified versions
- grey legend for logged static plots
- leaflet tab:
  - nice names in popups
  - Perhaps a "show all districts" checkbox?
- DATA - talk to JF and re-read MS ...
  - I don't recall what all of the other fields were? How did we do states in the end?
  - (Would there be tie-breaking with states? I don't recall how I did that?)
  - Which year are the surfaces in the app? Are the same as the ones in the paper?
- revise README and LANDING PAGE OF APP:
  - workflow - only cover bits in app/MS
  - data 
    - links (where I don't have a DOI)
    - extra sets? Indian national data?
- links for app/repo - talk to RP:
  - ... fork to IDDO GH for repo?
  - ... common IDDO login to shinyapps.io? (rsconnect)
