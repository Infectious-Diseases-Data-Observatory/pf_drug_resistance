TODO
- static plots 
  - remake with extra variables
  - grey legends 
    (now there are two greys happening - NA and not supplied)
    (also need these in indiv filter plots)
- leaflet tab:
  - nice names in popups
  - Perhaps a "show all districts" checkbox?
- DATA - talk to JF and re-read MS ...
  - I don't recall what all of the other fields were? 
  - How did we do states in the end?
  - (Would there be tie-breaking with states? I don't recall how I did that?)
  - Which year are the surfaces in the app? Are the same as the ones in the paper?
    - theoretically have updated - double check
  - the model outputs don't look right .. k13 should be highest in the northeast ???
- revise README and LANDING PAGE OF APP:
  - workflow - only cover bits in app/MS
  - data 
    - links (where I don't have a DOI)
    - extra sets? Indian national data?
- links for app/repo - talk to RP:
  - ... fork to IDDO GH for repo?
  - ... common IDDO login to shinyapps.io? (rsconnect)
- autopopulate filters with nrow(district_attributes)
